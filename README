Luxeed LED Keyboard driver.

This is an Linux driver for the 
Luxeed deTA 100 LED Keyboard.

It is written in C using libusb.
The driver currently needs root access, unless udev is
configured to chown/chmod the device.

It is probably also portable to other operating
systems where libusb is ported.

The daemon creates a FIFO on /tmp/luxeed.
Clients can open and write commands to it.
