Luxeed LED Keyboard driver.

This is an Linux driver for the 
Luxeed deTA 100/200 LED Keyboards

It is written in C using libusb and libevent.
The driver currently needs root access, unless udev is
configured to chown/chmod the device.

It is probably also portable to other operating
systems where libusb is ported.

The daemon creates a localhost TCP socket.
Multiple clients can open and write commands to it.
