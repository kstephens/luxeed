Luxeed LED Keyboard driver.

Luxeed deTA100 LED Keyboard.

It is written in C using libusb.  

It is probably also portable to other operating
systems where libusb is ported.

Goal:

* Decipher the USB protocol / messages.
* Create a simple driver.
* Create a daemon that can recieve high-level events.

cd src
make install_prereqs (required sudo)
make test            (requires sudo)

Watch the pretty rainbow!
